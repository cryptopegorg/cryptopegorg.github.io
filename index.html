<h3>Does this project require the Bitcoin price to rise forever?</h3>
No. If the price of Bitcoin rises, the minters can get back their
excess backing (in the form of Bitcoin collateral that is excessive
or as a newly minted tokens).  As we use heavily smoothed price, the
minting rate will almost always go down. For example as we write this,
Bitcoin is around $7000, but our exponentially smoothed price factors
in history and is around $700. So as long as the price of Bitcoin does not
fall under $700, the smoothed price will rise. We want the backing
to be stable and sufficient; we are building a stablecoin after all. So
as time goes on, the minters will get back their excess backing as long
as Bitcoin price does not fall down significantly.
</p>
                        <p class="sec-para black">
That being said, our paper discusses what happens in case of significant drops
in price of Bitcoin and we believe the fundaments of Cryptopeg can survive
even in these scenarios.
</p>
                        <p class="sec-para black">
<h3>Does this project depend on <a href="http://www.rsk.co/">Rootstock</a>?</h3>
Our implementation is in Solidity, so currently yes. The idea can
be implemented for other smart contract platforms and we encourage
alternative implementations.
</p>
                        <p class="sec-para black">
<h3>Can we run this on other smart contract platforms like Ethereum?</h3>
While the implementation should be technically compatible with Ethereum,
Ethereum Classic and other platforms that can run Solidity smart
contracts, our smoothing parameter and minting rate calculations for
backing and value stability are based on historical Bitcoin prices. We
strongly discourage people running the code using other tokens as backing
unless they do all the work outlined in the whitepaper to ensure that
the backing is sufficient. The smoothing parameters are calculated
for Bitcoin.
</p>
                        <p class="sec-para black">
<h3>How do you expect to build network momentum to make Cryptopeg tokens
accepted above other competing stablecoins?</h3>
We are honestly no marketing wizards, but here are a few reasons why we
think we might get traction: First of all, our model does not depend on
a huge number of minters and huge market. As the currency is backed by bitcoin,
it has minimal value from the start (guaranteed by the possibility to claim
Bitcoin backing). So even with minimal network, even the first token has
a minimal value.</p>
<p>
The second reason we believe Cryptopeg might be successful is the fact that it
is an open-source project with no preferential treatment. It does not depend on
whales, venture capital support or big player that will spread the word.
Even we, the authors, don't have any sort of preferential treatment by the
smart contract or the ecosystem and there are no fees charges by the smart contract.
We would like to use this as a tool. We believe that this community aspect
mirrors the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto and Bitcoin and projects like Monero
that are built and spread by the community of developers and users. We hope to
gain trust by showing we can build and deliver a functioning product that we
want to use ourselves and we welcome contributions, forks, pull requests to
serve the blockchain community.
</p>
<p>
That being said, we are not "against" competition. We just believe that blockchain
world needs a stablecoin and that it does not matter if it is us who brings it to
the world or our "competition". We wish all stablecoin projects good luck and
if someone creates something better, we will use it ourselves.
			</p>
                        <p class="sec-para black">
<h3>Who is working on the project?</h3>
You!</p>
<p>
Jokes aside. The original authors prefer to stay anonymous. It is not about us.
We want to make the parallel financial system more usable and for that we need
a stable unit of account. That is our goal. The original idea was created by and
consulted with programmers, economists, Bitcoin investors, mathematicians and
other smart people. We welcome any contributions and are open to suggestions.
</p>
                        <p class="sec-para black">
<h3>What are the next steps?</h3>
We are working on an implementation that will run on Rootstock platform. At the
same time we are looking for feedback on the whitepaper to make sure we can explain
the project and the mechanics of it and find and fix all the bugs. If you have any
kind of concern, suggestion, idea or question, please contact us. We promise you will
soon have something to play with and we will have a decentralised stablecoin for world-wide
use in no time.
